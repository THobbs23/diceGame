Craps game made in Altera Quartus II

This a Craps game made for my Terasic DE0 Cylcone V FPGA board. A button on the board is pressed to roll the dice and the sum of the two dice is displayed in binary on the board's LEDs. When rolling the dice, one LED lights up if you've won by either hitting your point or hitting 7 or 11 without a point, and another LED will light up if you've lost by crapping out.

Included in the repository are screenshots of simulation testing of the two datapaths, along with schematics for the two datapaths and the top level.
